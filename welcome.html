    	<h2>About this project</h2>
    	"General Orders" are the rules and regulations which define the expected behavior of Police Officers. Despite their importance, they are often not made public. This project is an effort to bring transparency, by collecting and publishing General Orders of all police departments in the Chicago area.

    	<h2>Contributing</h2>
    	Contributions are welcome.

    	If you see a municipality missing, you can help by filing a FOIA request asking for those general orders. It's easy to do, and typically only requires sending two or three emails. If you're interested in helping out, please visit this project on <a href="https://github.com/jjarmoc/chicago-area-general-orders"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
