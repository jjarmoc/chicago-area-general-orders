General Orders form the standard operating procedures for their police departments. They govern everything from uniform standards to use of force policies. It is our firm belief that the public deserves the right to review and scrutinize these orders.

This repository aims at compiling the "General Orders" for all Chicago area Police Departments in a central location as an effort toward increasing transparency.
